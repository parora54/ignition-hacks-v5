## 🌟 **Inspiration**
In the fast-paced world of tech and business, students often feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information. The fear of not being prepared for hackathons or case competitions can lead to anxiety and even imposter syndrome. Many are left wondering, *"Where do I even begin?"*
